;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides functions to support ert, the Emacs Regression Test
;; framework. It includes:

;;  - a set of predicates for comparing strings, buffers and file contents.
;;  - explainer functions for all predicates giving useful output
;;  - macros for creating many temporary buffers at once, and for restoring the
;;    buffer list.
;;  - methods for testing indentation, by comparison or "round-tripping".
;;  - methods for testing fontification.

;; Assess aims to be a stateless as possible, leaving Emacs unchanged whether
;; the tests succeed or fail, with respect to buffers, open files and so on; this
;; helps to keep tests independent from each other. Violations of this will be
;; considered a bug.

;; Assess aims also to be as noiseless as possible, reducing and suppressing
;; extraneous messages where possible, to leave a clean ert output in batch mode.


;;; Status:

;; Assess is currently a work in progress; the API is not currently stable. I
;; may also considering winding this into ert-x, because then it can be used
;; to test core.

;; Assess used to be called sisyphus which seemed like a good idea when I
;; started, but I kept spelling it wrong.


;;; Code:

;; ** Preliminaries

;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'pp)
(require 'ert)
(require 'm-buffer-at)
(require 'm-buffer)
(require 'seq)
;; #+end_src

;; ** Advice

;; Emacs-24 insists on printing out results on a single line with escaped
;; newlines. This does not work so well with the explainer functions in assess
;; and, probably, does not make sense anywhere. So, we advice here. The use of
;; nadvice.el limits this package to Emacs 24.4. Emacs 25 has this fixed.

;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun assess--ert-pp-with-indentation-and-newline (orig object)
  (let ((pp-escape-newlines nil))
    (funcall orig object)))

(advice-add
 'ert--pp-with-indentation-and-newline
 :around
 #'assess--ert-pp-with-indentation-and-newline)
;; #+end_src

;; ** Deliberate Errors

;; Sometimes during testing, we need to throw an "error" deliberately. Assess'
;; own test cases do this to check that state is preserved with this form of
;; non-local exit. Throwing `error' itself is a bit dangerous because we might
;; get that for other reasons; so we create a new symbol here for general use.

;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(if (fboundp 'define-error)
    (define-error 'assess-deliberate-error
      "An error deliberately caused during testing."
      'error)
  (put 'assess-deliberate-error
       'error-conditions
       '(error assess-deliberate-error))
  (put 'assess-deliberate-error
       'error-message
       "A error deliberately caused during testing."))
;; #+end_src

;; ** Buffer creation

;; For tests, it is often better to use temporary buffers, as it is much less
;; affected by the existing state of Emacs, and much less likely to affect future
;; state; this is particularly the case where tests are being developed as the
;; developer may be trying to change or write test files at the same time as
;; Emacs is trying to use them for testing.

;; Emacs really only provides a single primitive `with-temp-buffer' for this
;; situation, and that only creates a single temporary buffer at a time. Nesting
;; of these forms sometimes works, but fails if we need to operate on two buffers
;; at once.

;; So, we provide an environment for restoring the buffer list. This allows any
;; creation of buffers we need for testing, followed by clean up afterwards. For
;; example, a trivial usage would be to remove buffers explicitly created.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-with-preserved-buffer-list
;;    (get-buffer-create "a")
;;    (get-buffer-create "b")
;;    (get-buffer-create "c"))
;; #+end_src

;; Any buffer created in this scope is removed, whether this is as a direct or
;; indirect result of the function. For example, this usage creates a ~*Help*~
;; buffer which then gets removed again.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-with-preserved-buffer-list
;;    (describe-function 'self-insert-command))
;; #+end_src

;; This does not prevent changes to existing buffers of course. If ~*Help*~ is
;; already open before evaluation, it will remain open afterwards but with
;; different content.

;; Sometimes, it is useful to create several temporary buffers at once.
;; `assess-with-temp-buffers' provides an easy mechanism for doing this, as
;; well as evaluating content in these buffers. For example, this returns true
;; (actually three killed buffers which were live when the `mapc' form runs).

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-with-temp-buffers
;;       (a b c)
;;     (mapc #'buffer-live-p (list a b c)))
;; #+end_src

;; While this creates two buffers, puts "hellogoodbye" into one and "goodbye"
;; into the other, then compares the contents of these buffers with `assess='.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-with-temp-buffers
;;       ((a (insert "hello")
;;           (insert "goodbye"))
;;        (b (insert "goodbye")))
;;     (assess= a b))
;; #+end_src

;; Finally, we provide a simple mechanism for converting any assess type into a
;; buffer. The following form, for example, returns the contents of the ~.emacs~
;; file.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-as-temp-buffer
;;       (assess-file "~/.emacs")
;;     (buffer-string))
;; #+end_src

;; *** Implementation

;; ** Entity Comparison

;; In this section, we provide support for comparing strings, buffer or file
;; contents. The main entry point is `assess=', which works like `string=' but
;; on any of the three data types, in any order.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   ;; Compare Two Strings
;;   (assess= "hello" "goodbye")

;;   ;; Compare the contents of Two Buffers
;;   (assess=
;;    (assess-buffer "assess.el")
;;    (assess-buffer "assess-previous.el"))

;;   ;; Compare the contents of Two files
;;   (assess=
;;    (assess-file "~/.emacs")
;;    (assess-file "~/.emacs"))

;;   ;; We can use core Emacs types also
;;   (assess=
;;    (assess-buffer "assess.el")
;;    (get-buffer "assess-previous.el"))

;;   ;; And in any combination; here we compare a string and the contents of a
;;   ;; file.
;;   (assess=
;;    ";; This is an empty .emacs file"
;;    (assess-file "~/.emacs"))
;; #+end_src

;; In addition, `assess=' has an "explainer" function attached which produces a
;; richer output when `assess=' returns false, showing diffs of the string
;; comparison. Compare, for example, the results of running these two tests, one
;; using `string=' and one using `assess='.

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; F temp
;;     (ert-test-failed
;;      ((should
;;        (string= "a" "b"))
;;       :form
;;       (string= "a" "b")
;;       :value nil))

;; F test-assess=
;;     (ert-test-failed
;;      ((should
;;        (assess= "a" "b"))
;;       :form
;;       (assess= "a" "b")
;;       :value nil :explanation "Strings:
;; a
;; and
;; b

;; \\ No newline at end of file
;; --- 1 ----
;; ! b
;; \\ No newline at end of file

;; "))
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; As `assess=' has a compatible interface with `string=' it is also possible
;; to add this explainer function to `string=' for use with tests which do not
;; otherwise use assess, like so:

;; #+begin_src elisp
;; (put 'string= 'ert-explainer 'assess-explain=)
;; #+end_src

;; Currently, `assess' uses the ~diff~ program to do the comparison if it is
;; available, or falls back to just reporting a difference -- this could do with
;; improving, but it is at least no worse than the existing behaviour for string
;; comparison.

;; *** Implementation

;; We start by writing a file silently -- this is important because the
;; ~*Messages*~ buffer should not be affected by the machinery of a failing test,
;; as it hides what is happening from the test code.

;; #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun assess--write-file-silently (filename)

print any messages!"
  (write-region

   filename nil
   'dont-display-wrote-file-message))
;; #+end_src

;; Diff does a nicer comparison than anything in Emacs, although a lisp
;; implementation would have been more portable. Diff is used by quite a few
;; other tools in Emacs, so probably most people will have access to diff.

;; ** Opening files

;; Opening files presents a particular problem for testing, particularly if we
;; open a file that is already open in the same or a different Emacs. For batch
;; use of Emacs with parallelisation, the situation becomes intractable.

;; A solution is to copy files before we open them, which means that they can be
;; changed freely. Largely, the copied file will behave the same as the main file;
;; the only notable exception to this is those features which depend on the
;; current working directory (dir-local variables, for example).

;; ~assess-make-related-file~ provides a simple method for doing this. For
;; example, this form will return exactly the contents of ~my-test-file.el~, even
;; if that file is current open in the current Emacs (even if the buffer has not
;; been saved). Likewise, a test opening this file could be run in a batch Emacs
;; without interfering with an running interactive Emacs.

;;       (assess-make-related-file "dev-resources/my-test-file.el")

;; We also add support for opening a file, as if it where opened interactively,
;; with all the appropriate hooks being run, in the form of the

;; we can write the following expression without removing our ~.emacs~.

  "Create temporary file hierarchy according to SPEC and run FORMS.

SPEC is a list of specifications for file system entities which
are to be created.

File system entities are specified as follows:

1. a string FILE is the name of file to be created
  - if the string contains \"/\", parent directories are created
    automatically
  - if the string ends with \"/\", a directory is created
2. a list of two elements (FILE CONTENT) specifies filename and the
  content to put in the file
  - the \"/\" rules apply in the same way as in 1., except you can not
    create a directory this way
3. a list where car is a string and cadr is a list (DIR SPEC) is a
  recursive specification evaluated with DIR as current directory
  - the \"/\" rules apply in the same way as in 1., except you can not
    create a file this way, a directory is always created

An example showing all the possibilities:

  (\"empty_file\"
   \"dir/empty_file\"
   \"dir/subdir/\"
   (\"non_empty_file\" \"content\")
   (\"dir/anotherdir/non_empty_file\" \"tralala\")
   (\"big_dir\" (\"empty_file\"
              (\"non_empty_file\" \"content\")
              \"subdir/empty_file\")))

If we want to run some code in a directory with an empty file
\"foo.txt\" present, we call:

  (assess-with-filesystem \\='(\"foo\")
    (code-here)
    (and-some-more-forms))

You should *not* depend on where exactly the hierarchy is created.
By default, a new directory in `temporary-file-directory' is
created and the specification is evaluated there, but this is up

;; ** Indentation functions

;; There are two main ways to test indentation -- we can either take unindented
;; text, indent it, and then compare it to something else; or, we can roundtrip
;; -- take indented code, unindent it, re-indent it again and see whether we end
;; up with what we started. Assess supports both of these.

;; Additionally, there are two different ways to specific a mode -- we can either
;; define it explicitly or, if we are opening from a file, we can use the normal
;; `auto-mode-alist' functionality to determine the mode. Assess supports both
;; of these also.

;; The simplest function is `assess-indentation=' which we can use as follows.
;; In this case, we have mixed a multi-line string and a single line with
;; control-n characters; this is partly to show that we can, and partly to make
;; sure that the code works both in an `org-mode' buffer and an ~*Org Src*~ buffer.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-indentation=
;;    'emacs-lisp-mode
;;    "(assess-with-find-file
;;   \"~/.emacs\"
;;   (buffer-string))"
;;    "(assess-with-find-file\n    \"~/.emacs\"\n  (buffer-string))")
;; #+end_src

;; #+RESULTS:
;; : t

;; Probably more useful is `assess-roundtrip-indentation=' which allows us to
;; just specify the indented form; in this case, the string is first unindented
;; (every line starts at the first position) and then reindented. This saves the
;; effort of keeping the text in both the indented and unindent forms in sync
;; (but without the indentation).

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-roundtrip-indentation=
;;    'emacs-lisp-mode
;;    "(assess-with-find-file\n    \"~/.emacs\"\n  (buffer-string))")
;; #+end_src

;; #+RESULTS:
;; : t

;; While these are useful for simple forms of indentation checking, they have
;; the significant problem of writing indented code inside an Emacs string. An
;; easier solution for longer pieces of code is to use
;; `assess-file-roundtrip-indentation='. This opens a file (safely using
;; `assess-make-related-file'), unindents, and reindents. The mode must be set
;; up automatically by the file type.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;   (assess-file-roundtrip-indentation=
;;     "assess.el")
;; #+end_src

;; #+RESULTS:

;; All of these methods are fully supported with ert explainer functions -- as
;; before they use diff where possible to compare the two forms.

;; ** Font-Lock

;; Here we define two predicates that can be used to checking
;; fontification/syntax highlighting; as with indentation, one accepts strings
;; but requires an explicit mode, while the other reads from file and depends on
;; the normal Emacs mechanisms for defining the mode. These two are
;; `assess-font-at=' and `assess-file-font-at='. Both of these have the same
;; interface and have attached explainer functions. Here, we show examples with
;; `assess-face-at='.

;; The simplest use is to specify a point location and a face. This returns true
;; if at least that face is present at the location.

;; #+begin_src elisp
;;    (assess-face-at=
;;     "(defun x ())"
;;     'emacs-lisp-mode

;; face. This checks that the given font is present at every location.

;;     'emacs-lisp-mode
;;     '(2 8)
;;     '(font-lock-keyword-face font-lock-function-name-face))
;; #+end_src

;; It is also possible to define locations with regexps; again either one or
;; multiple regexps can be used. With a single string, all matches are checked,
;; with the first match to the first is checked, then the next match to the
;; second, incrementally.

;; The locations can also be specified as a `lambda' which takes a single
